# tB-essentials
A short bash script that downloads some free Mac apps that I find to be pretty essential

Currently the script only includes 3 apps. Currently it's latest versions of everything, but I don't know whether I'll need to modify links after updates are made.

The 3 apps are:

1. CoconutBattery – Battery monitoring application that allows you to check the battery health of your Mac and a connected iOS device
2. Itsycal – Status bar calendar that syncs with the macOS calendar app.
3. AppCleaner – Searches for linked files that an application creates, allowing you to free up some space when uninstalling an app.
